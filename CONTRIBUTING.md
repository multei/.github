## Which IDE should I use?

In the beginning, we used IntelliJ's WebStorm to code.
Therefore, you will probably find the `.idea /` directory in each of the projects.
We take care to add any files that might conflict with your _workspace_ to `.gitignore`.

Feel free to use other IDEs and editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom or Sublime.
